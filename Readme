## Usage

The entry point of the application is the `App` component in the `App.txs` file. The `App` component sets up the navigation system and renders different screens based on the user's actions.

The app supports the following screens:

-   `LoginPage`: Allows users to log in to the app.
-   `SignupPage`: Allows new users to create an account.
-   `HomePage`: Displays the home screen with customized header and navigation drawer.
-   `OrdersPage`: Displays the orders screen with a customized header.

The navigation between screens is handled using the React Navigation library.
